Integrate social media authentication and sharing features to enhance user engagement and simplify the signup process.

### 4. Testing and CI/CD

Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the application. Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

### 5. Advanced Search and Filters

Enhance the movie search functionality with advanced filters, sorting options, and additional metadata to help users find movies more easily.
